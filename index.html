    <h1>Future Vortex — FTC Team 30326</h1>
    <p>
      Future Vortex is a FIRST Tech Challenge team from Comfortable School No. 97 in Almaty.
      Our team was created by students who wanted more than just to participate in competitions —
      we wanted to understand engineering deeply, experience real teamwork, and grow through
      challenges that mirror real-world engineering problems.

<section id="about">
<h2>About Us & Our Origins</h2>

<p>
Future Vortex is a robotics team based at Comfortable School No. 97 in Almaty.
Our journey began in 2025 at the FGC competition, where students with different
backgrounds and skill levels came together for a single purpose — to build robots
and grow as engineers. At that moment, we were not experts. We lacked experience,
confidence, and deep technical knowledge, but we had motivation and curiosity.
</p>

<p>
After FGC 2025, our team decided to continue in the FIRST Tech Challenge.
FTC introduced us to a new level of engineering complexity: tighter tolerances,
higher competition, and a stronger emphasis on documentation, strategy,
and continuous improvement. Each member had to take responsibility for learning,
teaching others, and contributing to the team.
</p>

<p>
Today, Future Vortex is more than just a robotics team.
It is a community of young innovators who believe that technology can change the world.
We learn not only how to build robots, but also how to communicate,
analyze failures, manage time, and lead under pressure.
Our goal is simple but ambitious: to grow, create, and inspire.
</p>

<h3>Why the name “Future Vortex”?</h3>

<p>
The name “Future Vortex” reflects our vision and energy.
The word “Future” represents our focus on progress, innovation,
and constant development. We always look ahead, searching for better solutions
and new discoveries. The word “Vortex” symbolizes power, movement,
and unstoppable energy. Just like a vortex, our team pulls ideas, creativity,
and technology into a single powerful flow of growth.

<h2>Robot Engineering & Design Philosophy</h2>

<p>
Our robot is the physical result of months of engineering iteration,
testing, and problem-solving. From the earliest design stages,
we focused on reliability, simplicity, and adaptability.
Rather than trying to build the most complex robot,
we aimed to build a robot that performs consistently under competition pressure.
</p>

<p>
During early competitions, we faced mechanical failures,
inconsistent performance, and limitations in durability.
Instead of ignoring these problems, we treated each failure as data.
We analyzed broken components, reviewed match footage,
and redesigned mechanisms using CAD tools.
Weight reduction, reinforcement of stress points,
and improved cable management became key priorities.
</p>

<p>
Software also played a major role in our robot’s evolution.
We improved control algorithms, refined driver assistance features,
and optimized autonomous routines.
Through repeated testing and tuning,
we increased accuracy, reduced cycle time,
and improved overall match consistency.

<h2>Competitions, Challenges & Growth</h2>

<p>
Throughout the season, Future Vortex participated in multiple FTC competitions,
each presenting unique challenges and learning opportunities.
Every event tested our technical skills, teamwork, and ability to adapt quickly.
</p>

<h3>Bishkek Regional</h3>
<p>
At the Bishkek Regional, our team achieved the role of Winning Alliance Captain.
This competition tested our endurance and leadership.
Mechanical wear during playoffs forced us to perform rapid repairs and adjustments.
We learned how to stay calm under pressure and support alliance partners effectively.
</p>

<h3>Astana Regional</h3>
<p>
Astana Regional highlighted the importance of software stability.
While our mechanical systems performed well,
software inconsistencies affected match reliability.
By analyzing logs and driver feedback,
we refactored control logic and improved system robustness.
</p>

<h3>Burabay & Almaty Regionals</h3>
<p>
These competitions emphasized strategy and consistency.
Strong defensive opponents forced us to rethink our gameplay.
Driver training, strategic planning, and communication improvements
allowed us to remain competitive and adaptable.
</p>
