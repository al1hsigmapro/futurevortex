<h1>Future Vortex — FTC Team 30326</h1>
<p>
Future Vortex is a FIRST Tech Challenge team from Comfortable School No.97 in Almaty, Kazakhstan.
Our journey began at the FGC 2025 competition, where a group of students united with one clear purpose:
to build robots, learn engineering through real challenges, and grow into a true competitive team.
From the very beginning, we focused not only on results, but on understanding why systems fail,
how designs evolve, and how teamwork transforms individual skills into collective strength.
</p>

<p>
After FGC, we entered the FIRST Tech Challenge ecosystem, where the level of engineering,
strategic thinking, and responsibility increased dramatically. Each competition forced us
to analyze our mistakes, redesign mechanisms, rewrite code, and improve communication inside
the team. Mechanical breakdowns, unstable shooting, and inconsistent performance were not setbacks —
they became lessons that shaped our final robot and mindset.
</p>

<p>
Today, Future Vortex is more than a robotics team. It is a community of young engineers,
designers, programmers, and leaders who believe that technology is a tool for growth.
Our goal is not only to win matches, but to inspire others, share knowledge,
and prove that dedication and iteration lead to real progress.
</p>

<h2>Why “Future Vortex”?</h2>
<p>
The name reflects our identity. “Future” represents our constant focus on development,
innovation, and long-term vision. “Vortex” symbolizes energy, motion, and unstoppable momentum.
We are a vortex of ideas, creativity, and engineering solutions, pulling challenges into
a flow of growth and transformation.

<h2>Robot Overview — IMPULSE</h2>
<div class="grid robot">
<div>

</div>
<div>
<p>
Our robot, named <b>IMPULSE</b>, was designed with one core objective:
to act quickly, precisely, and reliably in every match scenario.
The concept of impulse in physics — the transfer of force that sets an object into motion —
perfectly represents our design philosophy.
</p>

<p>
Throughout the season, we went through multiple iterations.
Early designs suffered from inconsistent launching and mechanical complexity.
By simplifying mechanisms, reducing weight, and switching to more stable systems,
we achieved higher accuracy and reliability.
</p>

<p>
IMPULSE features a catapult-based outtake powered by rubber bands,
providing consistent launch force compared to unstable flywheel systems.
The drivetrain is built on a GoBILDA chassis with mecanum wheels,
allowing precise omni-directional movement and smooth control in both autonomous and tele-op.
</p>

<p>
Failures during early competitions taught us critical lessons in stress distribution,
material choice, and system integration. Each redesign made the robot stronger,
faster, and more competition-ready.

<h2>Competitions & Growth</h2>
<div class="timeline">

<div>
<h3>Bishkek FIRST Regional</h3>
<p>
At Bishkek, we faced high-level alliances and intense match pressure.
Our strengths were drivetrain stability and alliance coordination.
Weaknesses included early shooting inconsistency, which we addressed
by adjusting launch angles and rubber tension.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Almaty FIRST Regional</h3>
<p>
This competition highlighted our growth. Improved autonomous routines,
better communication, and mechanical reliability led to stronger results.
Winning the Control Award validated our engineering decisions.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Daryn Qualifier</h3>
<p>
Here, we focused on consistency. Although matches were demanding,
our robot performed reliably, and we secured Innovate Award 2nd Place,
proving our design evolution and documentation strength.
